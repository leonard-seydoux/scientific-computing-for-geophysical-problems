    "This notebook relies on the four following Python libraries; please ensure that the virtual Python environment you are using includes them correctly:\n",
    "- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki), an open-source project that provides a Python framework for processing seismological data. It provides parsers for standard file formats, clients to access data centers, and signal processing routines that allow the manipulation of seismological time series.\n",
    "- [NumPy](https://numpy.org), an open-source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python.\n",
    "- [SciPy](https://numpy.org), fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If unavailable on your machine, the following steps will guide you towards correctly installing the packages mentioned above. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a Python package manager that allows you to install Python libraries easily and is available from the virtual machine. If you wish to install it on your machine locally, please follow the instructions at https://www.anaconda.com. The following steps create a new environment named `scientific_computing` and install the latest version of Python 3.10 with ObsPy and Matplotlib. Note that the library NumPy is automatically installed with ObsPy. This will allow you to run this notebook properly."

Here we show an example of how to download seismic data from the IRIS datacenter with the `Client` interface of `obspy`. Once the interface is connected to a client of interest, we can request a seismic waveform by specifying several metadata such as the network code, the station code, the location of the sensor in the station, the channel name, the start and end datetimes, and other information. Please check the [documentation of the `get_waveform` method](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_waveforms.html).\n",
