# Scientific Computing for Geophysical Problems

The lecture slides are available in the [Lectures](Lectures/) folder. The corresponding notebooks are in the [Notebooks](Notebooks/) folder. These two folders will be updated as we advance. The solutions will also be published online. 

## 1. Introduction to Observational Seismology

This first lecture and lab session is dedicated to observational seismology, seismological observations and problems, seismological data from collection to distribution and future seismic instruments. 

## 2. Location of earthquake epicenters

The second lecture will look for earthquake position in space based on the differential travel times between the _P_ and _S_ seismic waves.
